# challenge_5

# Note For Instructors:
We did most development using the particle build IDE, which has its own saving mechanism.  Commits to github do not necessarily reflect the balance of work done on this challenge, as we mostly were working together from the same laptop (Connor's) and pushing to github when we wanted to save the working state.

Go in a straight line down a hallway with a crawler

If you haven't installed the Particle API JS, run:

npm install particle-api-js

If you get a "PID" error building the build.particle.io code, you need to manually include it from the libraries within the GUI.
